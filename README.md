#Weather App

# Struggled with this challenge due to constant 400 errors and not knowing where my code went wrong

#Feedback on how where i went wrong is greatly appreciated.

#still managed to create basic html and css foundations

#If i were to manually input the city name into the URL it would display all the data.
# However it doesn't seem to like the code I created in order to read the city input into the search box 

#created code to save and store the search history however, it isn't displaying.
